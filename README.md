# deepDream

Deep Dream model for any image size

View `python/input` to view the original images, and `python/output/IMAGE_NUM` to view the output of all layers for every example image.

Currently to run, you must have 16 images with 16 files (see layout of current examples). This will be changed to be better soon.
